There, I enrolled in the {second-degree} track, which allowed me to strengthen my skills in software development, system architecture, and IT project management.",
  "first-degree": "double degree",
  "second-degree": "Software and Information Systems",

  "professional-experience": "It has been almost two years since I started working at {renault}, specifically within the {ampere} entity. During the first year, I developed a Python library to optimize the management of automotive diagnostic specifications, ensure data reliability through consistency tests, and automate certain repetitive tasks. This year, I am focusing on developing Wireshark plugins to decode proprietary network protocols used in vehicles. This requires a strong understanding of network protocols and expertise in automotive connectivity.",

  "fun-facts": "When I was little, I never missed an episode of the show {emission}. I was convinced that one day, I too would have a magic board and a lab truck to explain improbable things. It fueled my curiosity for science and technology. The result: 15 years later, still no truck, but a PC, code everywhere, and servers running in a corner. In the end, it’s kind of the same… without Jamy’s checkered shirts."
